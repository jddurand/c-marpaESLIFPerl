# ABSTRACT: ESLIF base

our $VERSION = '6.0.33'; # TRIAL VERSION


#
# We keep two internal hashes:
# - MULTITONS is holding multiton constants
#   key is the engine (an IV) and value is the object instance
#
# - MULTITONS_FOR_GLOBAL_DESTRUCTION is used for global destruction
#   key is the engine (an IV) and value is the object destructor code
#
# This is because at global destruction we cannot afford to use something
# that still constain object instances. At this stage, only pure perl constants
# do survive.
#
# DESTROY() is using:
# - MULTITONS when not in global destruction
# - MULTITONS_FOR_GLOBAL_DESTRUCTION when in global destruction
#
# CLONE() is completely reaffecting the keys of both hashes.

=head1 NAME

MarpaX::ESLIF::Base - ESLIF base

=head1 VERSION

version 6.0.33

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All L<MarpaX::ESLIF> object inherits from this class, that takes care of clone and proper order destruction.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $class->new($clonable, $eq, $allocate, $dispose, @arguments)

Generic constructor using C<$allocate->(@args)>. If C<$eq> is set, the instance is implicitly a multiton. If C<$clonable> is a true value, the instance is clonable.

=head2 $self->DESTROY()

Generic destructor. It always calls C<$self>'s C<dispose> method.

=head2 CLONE()

Manages clonable instances.

=head2 $class->SHALLOW($engine)

Create a shallow instance of C<$class> based on C<$engine>, that is required. This instance cannot be cloned and, when being destroyed, will have no effect on the engine.
